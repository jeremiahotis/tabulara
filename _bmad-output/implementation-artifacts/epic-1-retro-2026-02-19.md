# Epic 1 Retrospective - Secure Session Intake and Extraction Readiness

Date: 2026-02-19
Epic: 1
Status: completed

## Participants
- Jeremiah (Project Lead)
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)

## Epic Summary
- Stories completed: 5/5
- Epic focus delivered: secure local runtime bootstrap, command-handler mutation path, import + duplicate handling, preprocessing/reprocessing, extraction with rollback behavior
- Canonical tracker source: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`

## What Went Well
- Epic 1 implementation was completed end-to-end.
- Command/event discipline improved across stories.
- API and E2E automation coverage expanded story-by-story.

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- Recurring status mismatch between story markdown `Status:` and sprint tracker status created confusion and duplicate work.
- Process trust was degraded by dual status representations behaving as independent writers.

## Key Insight
The major systemic issue was not feature implementation throughput; it was status integrity. Execution reliability requires single-source status authority with hard enforcement gates.

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through
- Not applicable (no prior epic retrospective detected).

## Next Epic Preview (Epic 2)
Epic 2 remains backlog and now includes Story 2.12:
- `2-12-enforce-story-status-integrity-across-artifacts`

This story is a preparation gate to restore reliable flow and prevent repeated status drift.

## Significant Discovery and Required Plan Update
### Discovery
Status integrity drift is a cross-project blocker causing repeated rework and unreliable handoffs.

### Impact
Epic planning and review workflow require governance updates before normal throughput continues.

### Approved Change Proposal
- Proposal file: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/sprint-change-proposal-2026-02-19.md`
- Decision: approved for implementation
- Scope: moderate
- Routing: SM/PO + Dev + QA

## Action Plan
### Process Improvements
1. Enforce canonical status authority in sprint tracker and treat story markdown status as derived.
   - Owner: Scrum Master / Product Owner
2. Add CI and local guard checks that fail on story-status mismatch.
   - Owner: Development + QA
3. Enforce deterministic status transitions through scripted/commanded path only.
   - Owner: Development
4. Require review evidence before transition to `done`.
   - Owner: QA + Scrum Master

### Technical Debt / Reliability
1. Eliminate dual-writer status behavior in workflow practice and templates.
   - Owner: Scrum Master
2. Keep deterministic mismatch reporting as a mandatory quality gate.
   - Owner: QA

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing and quality: partially verified / needs continued QA hard-gates
  - Basis: strong automated test passes across stories, plus observed process inconsistency and occasional local test-environment contention.
- Deployment status: pending / local-only
  - Basis: no recorded production release state for Epic 1 deliverables in implementation artifacts.
- Stakeholder acceptance: accepted
- Unresolved blockers reported: none beyond the approved status-integrity control implementation

## Commitments
- Implement Story 2.12 before normal Epic 2 throughput.
- Adopt proposal controls from `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/sprint-change-proposal-2026-02-19.md`.
- Treat status integrity as a non-negotiable execution gate.

## Closeout
Epic 1 retrospective is complete and recorded. The team will use these controls to prevent recurrence of status trust failures.
